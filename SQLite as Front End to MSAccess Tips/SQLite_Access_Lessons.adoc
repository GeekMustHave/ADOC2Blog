The Back Up and Security (BUS) system is used to help track all the various systems, back up status, backup scenarios and security.
It will be a throw together system initially to allow to eliminate the spreadsheet.
It will also be an experiment in using SQLite as the back-end for a Microsoft Access 2016 front end.

== Database .Net DBA tool

My tool of choice for maintaining any SQL database, including SQLite,  is the Database .NET program from http://fishcodelib.com/Database.htm[ Fish-Lib].
It is only available for the Windows environment.  
Database .Net covers any SQL database I currently use including Teradata. 
Database .Net has a command line interface that allows it to be used in PowerShell script to perform standard DBA maintenance tasks.

It is possible to have Database .Net open and doing work and have the MSAccess frontend open doing work.  
Just don't attempt to update data in objects you are working on the schema.

NOTE: Any schema changes in the SQLite database schema will require a relink of the tables in the MSAccess front end.

Use the `Linked Table Manager` from the main ribbon and just refresh all of the linked tables.

== Write Conflict issues

=== Boolean Default

Initially one of the tables (Points) was experiencing a `write conflict` error any time something was updated.

Issue appeared to be that one of the columns in this table was defined as `boolean` and had no default set up.

=== ODBC DSN `Sync Mode` setting

Second issue was that the ODBC DSN configuration had one setting incorrect.

The `Sync Mode` setting needs to be set to `Normal`

== Views are for Viewing

In many SQL based application I have created One-To-One views of the tables.
These view can only be `viewed`, no editing is allowed.
