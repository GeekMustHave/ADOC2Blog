Over the years I have tinkered with the idea of using ASCIIDoctor documents as the basis for a blog service.
The Blog would be statically delivered and as damn simple as possible.

== Introduction

I use ASCIIDoctor to do the majority of my documentation and have gotten good at it with special editor extension and snippets.

I have looked at a number of Open source solutions and most of them are either too complex or difficult to implement.

* Hugo - Based on `Go` and a defined file structure that doesn't allow the article to exist in a directory atomically.
* Gatsby - Difficult to install and is geared more towards document repository
* Antora.org - Requires GIT repositories to create a document site generator, too many unneeded features
* Vue based - Flexible but used GraphQL for access to even the filesystem, ASCIIDoc not mentioned

== Requirements

These are the requirements for a basic utility to manage ASCIIDoctor files specifically and generate a blog automatically

* Use Blog articles as separate directories
* Use ASCIIDoctor as the primary files for articles
* Use the content of the ASCIIDoctor file to drive the indexing
** The (=) title becomes the tile of the article
** The preamble (The first paragraph of the document)
** Date from the date line of the header
* index.html generated from index.adoc to all for template of index to be changed
* Blog order article is determined by a single text file in roo `order.txt` with a list of the directory name in the order they should appear in the blog
** Delete an article by (*) it in the `'order.txt`
* Use a FTPSync command to help move (New/Updated) generated content into web server
* Auto generate HTML & PDF if the coersponding ADOC is more than 1 day old
* Auto generate (Optional) the `order.txt` file of the sub-folder of the blog


== Prerequisites

* Definition of Blog article file naming
** readme.adoc for main document
** readme.png (Optional) for Blog article image
** ALl sub-directories in Blog article directory will be transferred except for `.exclude` folder
* Node FTPSync - To manage transfer of generated updates


>>>>>
== Web site 

The web site will be generated based on the layout in the `index.adoc` template.
This template can be modified for the page scaffolding.
Additional content or directions could be added.
